Home Page Ideas:
When the viewer opens the website the first thing I would want them to see the different works I've done.
On this page I would include my artwork and/or my photography (most likely just my photography would be included).
I would have a short introduction to give general background about what the website is about.
For instance: This page is about me and the creative works that I have done. On this website you will see various types
of work that I have done ranging from drawing/sketches to photography pieces.
The general information about myself would most likely be on the About Me page that would be added later on.
