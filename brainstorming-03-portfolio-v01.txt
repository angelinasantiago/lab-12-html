Portfolio Page Ideas:
This page would mainly be a gallery page of my work. I would try to group the images and work I have
done based off of similarity for aesthetic purposes. Some of these groupings would be based off color, subject,
time, and/or place.
Maybe add some extra details about the photographs or inspiration if applicable to the image/work.
